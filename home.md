The WeView 2 library is a tool for auto layout of iOS UIs.

* WeView 2 is an alternative to [iOS Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html).
* WeView 2 aims to provide an _easier, more natural, more expressive, and more maintainable_ way to create _dynamic, adaptive UIs_ with UIKit.
* WeView 2 takes a _declarative_ approach to layout using familiar concepts like _alignment_, _margins_ and _spacing_.
* WeView 2 builds on iOS' existing sizing and layout mechanisms.  
* WeView 2 is _lightweight_: less than 5k lines of code, no dependencies.
* WeView 2 is compatible with _iOS 5 and later_.
* WeView 2 is _free_ and _open source_. It is available under a [permissive license](License.html).
* WeView 2 is *easy to learn*: if you read the ["Basics" page of the tutorial](TutorialBasics.html), you'll know everything you need to know to get started.
