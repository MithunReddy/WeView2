# Tutorial 1: Overview


<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

The core of **WeView 2** is the __WeView__, a UIView that offers a variety of layouts for its subviews.

Here is an example WeView that has three subviews: a UILabel, a UIImageView and a UIButton.

<video WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="280" AUTOPLAY="true" controls="true" LOOP="true" class="embedded_video" >
 <source src="videos/video-1AC1BE13-D72E-45F5-95A3-80A8E925C210-24401-00023AED9C1B3FE7.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
 <source src="videos/video-1AC1BE13-D72E-45F5-95A3-80A8E925C210-24401-00023AED9C1B3FE7.webm" type="video/webm" />
 </video>


* **Declarative** WeViews use a declarative syntax that operates on a higher level than fixed sizes and positioning.
* **Properties**  Layout behavior is specified by setting properties on layouts and/or subviews.  In this case, the layout has 5pt __margins__ and 5pt __spacing__.  
* **Multiple Layout Types**  These three subviews use a __horizontal layout__.  **WeViews** have a variety of built-in layouts and support custom layouts as well.
