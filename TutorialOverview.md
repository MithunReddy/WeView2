# Tutorial 1: Overview


<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

The core of **WeView 2** is the __WeView__, a UIView that offers a variety of layouts for its subviews.

Here is an example WeView that has three subviews: a UILabel, a UIImageView and a UIButton.

<video WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="280" AUTOPLAY="true" controls="true" LOOP="true" class="embedded_video" >
 <source src="videos/video-1AC1BE13-D72E-45F5-95A3-80A8E925C210-24401-00023AED9C1B3FE7.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
 <source src="videos/video-1AC1BE13-D72E-45F5-95A3-80A8E925C210-24401-00023AED9C1B3FE7.webm" type="video/webm" />
 </video>


* **Layouts**.  These three subviews use a __horizontal layout__.  **WeViews** have a variety of built-in layouts and supports custom layouts as well.
* **Automation**.  Layout (that is, measurement and arrangement) takes place automatically.  You can intervene in the layout process, but generally don't need to.
* **Properties**.  Layout behavior is specified declaratively, by setting properties on the layout or the subviews.  In this case, the layout has 5pt __margins__ and 5pt __spacing__.
